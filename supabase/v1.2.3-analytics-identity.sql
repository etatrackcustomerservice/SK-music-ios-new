-- SK Music 1.2.3 — attach account identity to analytics events
--
-- Run AFTER v1.2.2-admin.sql. Idempotent: safe to re-run.
--
-- WHAT CHANGES: zemer_analytics gains a nullable user_id. Signed-in clients send
-- their id with the beacon; anonymous ones send nothing and the column stays
-- NULL. That single column is what turns the admin console's "recently played"
-- into a real per-song history, and what makes signed-in vs anonymous a
-- measurable split on the analytics dashboard.
--
-- TRUST MODEL — important, and deliberately narrow:
--   The beacon is UNAUTHENTICATED. The Worker takes the id from the request body
--   and does not verify it against a JWT (it has only the anon key, not the
--   project's JWT secret, so it cannot check a signature; resolving the token
--   against /auth/v1/user would mean a round trip per event). A hostile client
--   can therefore write events tagged with someone else's id.
--
--   That is acceptable ONLY because user_id here is analytics attribution and
--   NOTHING else: it grants no access, gates no content, and is never read to
--   make an authorization decision. It is displayed to admins as observed
--   history, which is exactly as trustworthy as the rest of the analytics
--   stream (ip, user agent and session are equally client-influenced).
--
--   Do NOT extend this column into any access-control path. If per-user history
--   ever needs to be trustworthy, the beacon has to carry a verified token.
-- ============================================================================

alter table public.zemer_analytics
  add column if not exists user_id uuid;

-- Deliberately NOT a foreign key to auth.users: analytics is append-only and
-- must never fail an insert (or cascade-delete history) because of an account's
-- lifecycle. A deleted user's rows simply keep an id that no longer resolves.

-- The admin console's per-user history is "this user's plays, newest first".
create index if not exists idx_za_user_created

-- identity_split — signed-in vs anonymous, for the dashboard card.
-- Counts DISTINCT people, not events: an account is one person however many
-- times they play something, and an anonymous visitor is counted by their
-- per-visitor id (meta->>'vid'), falling back to session so older rows still
-- register. Event counts are returned alongside because the two tell different
-- stories (accounts tend to play far more per head).
--
-- Readable by anyone: it returns only two integers and leaks nothing about who.
